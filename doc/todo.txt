-Connect RFM69W 915Mhz radio
 Solder header pins to Anarduino
 Solder header pins to LCD
 Breadboard+Anarduino+LCD
 Solder RFM69W, header pins to breadboard

-Migrate to a 3V controller, e.g. Arduino Due, in preparation for a 3V radio.
 Also high current power supply does not hurt.

-Replace LCD/keyboard shield with a separate 
 20x4 or 16x2 LCD and a keyboard on A0


-Add StopAll or WaitTilEndSwitch command. 
 Usage scenario: slide left slow, pan left slow, hit endswitch, stop all.

-Test interaction with panner/tilter motors 

-Test pan endswitches - failed for now - can't figure out how these work.

-Terminate motor wires in the Pan/Tilt head


Version 0.3

+Add new GUI mode for immediate control of one channel
 left right press and hold - move
 up/down sets the move speed
 The existing GUI is a multiple channel mode
 Switch between modes by press and hold of select
+Add ability to read commands from a serial port
+Pause/Resume - right when stop channel selected
+Add slider hardware and software interaction with it

Version 0.2

+Documentation

Version 0.1

+Add (unconditional) LOOP command. 
 Usage scenario: 
   BeginLoop
     slide left slow until endswitch is hit
     rest 5sec
     slide right slow until endswitch is hit
     rest 5sec
   EndLoop     
+Support trapezoidal velocity profiles to reduce jerks on the camera.
+Handle interrupts to process carriage hitting endswitches
+GUI: show remaining time for the selected command, not the very first one.
+GUI: when an active channel is selected Left/Right adjusts speed, Up/Down time
+Build a menu to choose channel to interact with, handle start/stop/ speedChange on every channel
